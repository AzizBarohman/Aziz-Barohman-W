An ultra sonic sensor, distance detecting trash can.

Its a project that my friend requests to make and funded by them. Easy to make because its already common in YouTube tutorials for an Arduino project. Should costs less than 20$ with a used arduino and hc-sr04 sensor.

Components that used in this Project :
1. Arduino Uno (Repurposed or Second hand)
2. HC-SR04 (Repurposed or Second hand)
3. Servo
4. Jumper 3x (for Arduino to HC-SR04)
5. Arduino to USB cable
6. Paper bin of less than 10 litre capacity
